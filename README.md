This is the best I could do. Help is greatly appreciated.*

## Run it locally

Included stocks:
- All S&P500 companies
- You can add additional ones with the `symbols.txt`

### Build & Run with Docker

(Execute these in the root folder of the project)

```shell script
# Build the image
$ docker build -t stock -f docker/Dockerfile .
# Run it
$ docker run --rm --name stock -v ./code -p 8050:8050 stock start.sh
```

After this you can access it at `localhost:8050`

> *Disclaimer*: in a proper setup you would create 2 different images, one for the RestAPI and one for the Client App.
Then with a `docker-compoase.yml` you could create the services. But just like with Heroku, this is a toy and local
deployment, so I won't do fancy stuff here. 

### Run directly

- `python rest_api.py`
    - Wait until the data creation and search model creation is done (1-2 mins)
- `python dash_app.py`
    - The environment variable `$REST_API_URL` controls the connection with the RestAPI. It should be the base URL
- Enjoy :sunglasses:

### Run with a single script

```shell script
$ ./start.sh
```

## Deployment to Heroku (toy deployment)

First of all, this is a mono-repo which is not ideal, but the deployment is just an example.
This is why a multi-buildpack solution is used with `heroku-community/multi-procfile`.

```shell script
$ heroku create stock-restapi --remote restapi
$ heroku buildpacks:add -a stock-restapi heroku/python
$ heroku buildpacks:add -a stock-restapi -i 1 heroku-community/multi-procfile
$ heroku config:set -a stock-restapi PROCFILE=Procfile_restapi
$ git push restapi master
$
$ heroku create stock-dash-client --remote dash
$ heroku buildpacks:add -a stock-dash-client heroku/python
$ heroku buildpacks:add -a stock-dash-client -i 1 heroku-community/multi-procfile
$ heroku config:set -a stock-dash-client PROCFILE=Procfile_dash
$ heroku config:set -a stock-dash-client REST_API_URL=https://stock-restapi.herokuapp.com --> this is the URL where we can reach the RestAPI
$ git push dash master
```

Heroku Files:
- `runtime.txt` describes the Python version
- `Procfile_restapi` Heroku Procfile for the RestAPI app 
- `Procfile_dash` Heroku Procfile for the Dash Client app 

## TODOs

- Backend
    - Proper logging and getting rid of `print`s
    - RAM and Speed measurements for the different Search Models
- Frontend
    - React frontend instead of the dash app
